Jeffrey Roach, December 2015

### Purpose

To predict air pollution score of cars


### Description

   It was recently discovered that Volkswagen installed software in their diesel cars that allow them to cheat on the air emissions test. The EPA gives scores between 1 and 10 based on these tests, so low emissions mean high scores. In light of the Volkswagen scandal, which cars have accurate test results and which ones donâ€™t?

   SmogSentry is a predictive model based on a car's specifications such as weight, horsepower, miles per gallon, etc. Utilizing the car's features, the model can be used as a screening tool to predict the car's air pollution output and potentially identify cars needing further investigation.
